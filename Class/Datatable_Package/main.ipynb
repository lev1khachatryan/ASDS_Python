    "If you are an R user, chances are that you have already been using the data.table package. Data.table is an extension of the data.frame package in R. It’s also the go-to package for R users when it comes to the fast aggregation of large data (including 100GB in RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "The R’s data.table package is a very versatile and a high-performance package due to its ease of use, convenience and programming speed. It is a fairly famous package in the R community with over 400k downloads per month and almost 650 CRAN and Bioconductor packages using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is in it for the Python users? Well, the good news is that there also exists a Python counterpart to thedata.table package called datatable which has a clear focus on big data support, high performance, both in-memory and out-of-memory datasets, and multi-threaded algorithms. In a way, it can be called as data.table’s younger sibling."

    "Modern machine learning applications need to process a humongous amount of data and generate multiple features. This is necessary in order to build models with greater accuracy. Python’s datatable module was created to address this issue. It is a toolkit for performing big data (up to 100GB) operations on a single-node machine, at the maximum possible speed. The development of datatable is sponsored by H2O.ai and the first user of datatable was Driverless.ai.\n",
    "\n",
    "This toolkit resembles pandas very closely but is more focussed on speed and big data support. Python’s datatable also strives to achieve good user experience, helpful error messages, and a powerful API. In this article, we shall see how we can use datatable and how it scores over pandas when it comes to large datasets."
